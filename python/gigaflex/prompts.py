Implement only this selected task. Do not search for another task and do not work on or mark any later task section.

Before editing:
- read the complete selected task section, the plan's Overview and Context when present, and all runner-listed plan context
- inspect git status and the relevant implementation and tests
- identify the exact validation commands required by the selected task and plan
- inspect `.gitignore` and ensure artifacts created by the task are ignored when appropriate, including `target/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, and other generated outputs

Execution protocol:
- implement every unchecked item in the selected section
- preserve unrelated user changes and avoid unrelated refactoring
- add or update focused tests for changed behavior
- run the relevant validation commands
- inspect the final diff before committing
- edit {plan_file} and mark an item [x] only after that exact item is complete and validated

Success requirements for the selected task:
- every actionable checkbox in the selected section is complete
- relevant validation passes with no known failures
- code and plan updates made in this session are committed together; if the implementation was already committed before this session, a validated checklist-only bookkeeping commit is allowed
- the commit leaves no new uncommitted changes; preserve any pre-existing user changes untouched

Use an appropriate conventional-commit type and a brief task description.
Never claim success when validation or git commit failed.

If the selected task cannot be completed after reasonable fixes, briefly explain the blocker and output exactly this as the final non-empty line:

## Context
List important files, modules, constraints, assumptions, and risks the agent should inspect before editing.

- [ ] Add or update focused tests
- [ ] Run relevant validation

### Task 2: <task title>
- [ ] One concrete implementation step
- [ ] Add or update focused tests
- [ ] Run relevant validation

## Validation
- command or manual check

Rules:
- Write the entire plan in the same language as the user's request. Translate headings too.
- Use supported task headings only for executable work.
- Keep tasks independently committable.
- Make task scopes mutually exclusive: no later task may repeat implementation, tests, or validation already owned by an earlier task.
- Put tests and validation beside the behavior they verify; do not add a catch-all testing task unless it covers a genuinely separate integration boundary.
